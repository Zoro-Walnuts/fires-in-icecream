# Rolle's Theorem
- Applicable if slope $= 0$
- If both ends of the interval are equal
	- w/ interval $[a, b]$ and $f(a) = f(b)$

### Steps:
- Make sure both ends of the interval are equal
- Get the derivative of $f(x)$ to get $c$
	- $f'(x) = f'(c) = 0$
## Example
$f(x) = x^3 - 4x$ at interval $[-2, 2]$

$f(-2) = 0; f(2) = 0$
- Since both ends of the interval are 0, apply Rolle's Theorem
$f'(c) = 0$
$f'(x) = 3x^2-4$
$f'(c) = 3c^2 - 4 = 0$
$c^2 = \frac{4}{3} = \pm \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}= \pm \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{3}$
