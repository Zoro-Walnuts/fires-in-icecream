# The appeal of Mechanical Keyboards

I never truly understood the appeal of mechanical keyboards. The only times that I had used a mechanical keyboard was when I go to computer shops (internet cafes) to play video games, and the noise honestly was more annoying than satisfying.

Now that I've bought a new laptop which came with a mechanical keyboard, I understand it a little better now. It might be different for everyone, but I feel the satisfaction coming from the feedback of the keys as I press them. The hefty feeling of the keys and the sound it produces MAKES ME WANT TO TYPE.

Writing notes and doing code is more appealing, I find myself looking forward to using the keyboard now. I still am not a big fan of RGB lights though.
