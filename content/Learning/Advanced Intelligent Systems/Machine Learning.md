# Machine Learning
![[Machine Learning Process.png]]
- uses data and algorithms to *imitate the way humans learn*
- When you don't know what rules the program is supposed to follow
- **Develops own program**
- Learns by *example* (training samples)
### Setup
- **Output Space** - *Target* variable to be estimated (independentVar)
- **Input Space** - *Features* / Attributes / Variables (dependentVar)
- **Hypothesis** - *Speculative relationship* between input / output spaces

### Workflow
- [[Preprocessing]]
- [[Modelling]]
- [[Evaluation]]
