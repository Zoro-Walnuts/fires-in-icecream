# Numerical Methods
- The study of algorithms using **numerical approximations** (ex. Limits)
### Some stuff you need to know
- Calculus 1 stuff (functions, limits, derivatives, and integration)
	- **Continuity** - if at a point $f(x)$ does not exit, it is [[discontinuous]]
	- **Differentiability** - if a function is continuous at a given interval

## Iterative Approximation Methods
> [!note] Note
> Picking a starting point usually depends on the interval
> ex. given interval $[2,4]$
> starting point for x in $f(x)$ is $\frac{2+4}{2} = 3$

2. [[Bisection Method]]
