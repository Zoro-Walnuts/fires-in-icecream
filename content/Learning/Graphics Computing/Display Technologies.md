# Display Technologies
- Quality
- Performance
- Energy Efficiency
- *CRT Displays*
	- Firing electron beams from an electron gun into a phosphorescent screen (60Hz or more)
	- Scan Lines - top left to bottom right - refreshes image by scanning pixels in a row
	- Excellent Color, Very fast response time
	- Large, heavy, consumes a lot of power; Burn-in, flickering
- *LCD (Liquid Crystal Display)*
	- Fixed native resolution
	- Backlit
	- Slow response times
- *LED (Light Emitting Diode)*
	- Type of LCD
	- Better brightness and contrast
	- More energy efficient
	- Fixed native resolution
- *Plasma*
	- Use small cells containing ionized gas that responds to electric fields
	- Consumes more power, generates more heat, susceptible to burn-in
- **Raster Display**
- Illuminating pixels on a grid of individual points
- **Frame Buffer** -memory area for picture in the form of pixel
- Grid is composed of up to millions of pixels depending on resolution
