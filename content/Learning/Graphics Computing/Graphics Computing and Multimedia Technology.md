# Graphics Computing and Multimedia Technology

- Creating 2D and 3D graphics and animations (Final Project)
- Lots of math ([[Linear Algebra]])

## Introduction to Computer Graphics
- Creation, modification, display of visual data
	- 2D Shapes
	- 3D Models
	- Animations
[[3 Main Tasks of Computer Graphics]]

>[!note] Real Time Graphics
> - AI has changed rending computer graphics
> - Upscaling
> - Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS)

> [!note] Augmented and Virtual Reality
> - Real time tracking and rendering
> - High fidelity visuals

> [!note] Digital Twins and Metaverse
> - Communal virtual shared environment
> - Virtual Worlds

- **Real Scene**
	- objects to be modeled
- **Model of the Scene**
	- *Choice of a View* - part of the world to be displayed
	- *Clipping* - Computes which objects are in view
	- *Visibility Considerations* - Objects in the clipping region
	- Results in a *pixel image*
		- Illumination
		- 2D Clipping

## [[Graphics Systems Configurations]]

### Graphics Software
1. **Application Program**
	- Creates, stores, retrieves data/objects to be pictured on screen
2. **Application Data**
	- Helps in producing images by sending a series of graphics output commands
3. **Graphics Systems**
	- Interacts
