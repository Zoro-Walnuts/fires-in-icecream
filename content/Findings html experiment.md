# Findings [[Testing html stuff]]
> [!error] This was wrong ahh hell
> - html/css/js files are stored in "./public"
> 	- They are referenced by calling "./example.js"

- I just put the js file into the "./static/" directory
	- The documentation says it's where you put stuff that isn't directly referenced by our markdown notes
	- It also holds the website icon and banners
- Hardcoding a login in JS is gonna be a cinch
	- Yes you can just inspect element and see the js file, but who cares, it's cool
	- I'm only really gonna use it for a little dnd project, so what's the harm
- Headers have an annoying link thing
	- Find a way to get header stylings without using header tags

- BIGGER THING
	- We can make html/css/js in obsidian and it works with quartz
